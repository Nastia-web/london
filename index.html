                <p>
                    In 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore upstream from Vauxhall
                    Bridge.[38] Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750–1285 BCE.[38] In 2010, foundations of
                    a large timber structure, dated to 4800–4500 BCE,[39] were found on the Thames's south foreshore
                    downstream from Vauxhall Bridge.[40] Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the
                    now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames.<a

                <h4>Roman London</h4>
                <p>
                    Despite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was
                    founded by the Romans around 47 AD,[2] about four years after their invasion of 43 AD.[41] This only
                    lasted until about 61 AD, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to the
                    ground.[42]

                    The next planned incarnation of Londinium prospered, superseding Colchester as the principal city of
                    the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a
                    population of about 60,000.[43] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London#Roman_London">read

                <h4>Anglo-Saxon and Viking-period London</h4>
                <p>
                    With the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of Londinium was effectively
                    abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin-in-the-Fields until about 450.[44]
                    From about 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old
                    Roman city.[45] By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of
                    large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded;
                    those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.[46] <a

                <h4>Middle Ages</h4>
                <p>
                    After winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in newly
                    completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.[49] William built the Tower of London, the first
                    of many such in England rebuilt in stone in the south-eastern corner of the city, to intimidate the
                    inhabitants.[50] In 1097, William II began building Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same
                    name. It became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster. <a

                <h4>Early modern</h4>
                <p>
                    During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism. Much of London
                    property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the
                    city.[57] In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up a main trading base (kontor) of England in London,
                    called the Stalhof or Steelyard. It remained until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen
                    and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway.[58] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and
                    undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries.[59]<a

                <h4>Late modern and contemporary</h4>
                <p>
                    With the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, an unprecedented growth in urbanisation took
                    place, and the number of High Streets (the primary street for retail in Britain) rapidly
                    grew.[77][78] London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925, with a population density
                    of 802 per acre (325 per hectare).[79] In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods,
                    such as Harding, Howell & Co.—one of the first department stores—located on Pall Mall, the streets
                    had scores of street sellers.[77] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming
                    14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.[80] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the
                    world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure
                    expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London
                    County Council was created out of county areas surrounding the capital.<a
